# Python Live Project 

## Introduction
In February of 2022, I worked with other students in the Tech Academy designing a web site using the Django Framework in PyCharm. We each contributed to our own portions of the site by designing pages with various functionality. It was my first experience using MicroSoft's Azure DevOps, CI/CD, using boards, and a deeper dive into version control. The page I built utilized an API from RapidAPI's and some web scraping from Beautiful Soup, both that were completely new to me and had to do some research on to get implemented. I'm excited to use these tools again and learn some more about them in the future.

### Tools For the Project:
* Pycharm (Python)
* Django
* Bootstrap 5
* Beautiful Soup
* RapidAPI
* HTML/JS/CSS

Below are some code snippets with a description of various parts of CRUD functionality of the project:

### Create
Here I began my first story with creating some models. My idea was to create a website that motorcycle riders could go in and create their motorcycle to rate. I started with setting up the different files i would need. The HTML page, Views, URL, Settings, Admin pages, etc.

Then I added in different functions, and created my database/models for motorcycle and route creation by the user.

Also some pathing to the various HTML pages for the site.

### Read
My next stories had me design the UI/UX part. This is the base page.

Here I've put in the page with it's functions for the user to create and save their data.

### Update and Delete
After that I created a page with links for the user to update or delete their previous input.

## Web Scraping
I first opted to add a web-scraper using Beautiful Soup Library. My first time dealing with scraping but i got the hang of it.

## API
With some time left, I was able to put in a REST API from GEOCity_dB that suggests a random nearby city for the user.
