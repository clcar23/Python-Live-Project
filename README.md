# Python Live Project 

## Introduction
In February of 2022, I worked with other students in the Tech Academy designing a web site using the Django Framework in PyCharm. We each contributed to our own portions of the site by designing pages with various functionality. It was my first experience in DevOps, CI/CD, using boards, and a deeper dive into version control. The page I built utilized a simple API and some web scraping both that were completely new to me and had to do some research on to get implemented. I'm excited to use these tools again and learn some more about them in the future.

Below are some code snippets with a description of various parts of the project:
